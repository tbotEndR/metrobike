# metrobike
Applied Data Science Project using live GeoJSON data from the LA Metro Bike service.
The program retrieves the current LA Metro Bike Station data and uses it to
  - display the k nearest stations with available bikes
  - display the k nearest stations with available docks
  - plan a route and include a suitable bike and dock along the way
  
The points are drawn onto a map which is then opened in a browser.

This was my first ever project using Python as well as the first time that I used Git.
